# reactReduxBoiler

This is a really basic app that has two components: 
    An input form container that takes in a string and a display container that shows that string reversed.
    I made this so people could see a quick and simple example of how react/redux works!
    
Once you are in the folder, you can start the app with
```npm start ```

Then head over to localhost:3001 in your browser. :)

"""NOTE: My npm modules are included in here so a direct download will take a few minutes~!"""
